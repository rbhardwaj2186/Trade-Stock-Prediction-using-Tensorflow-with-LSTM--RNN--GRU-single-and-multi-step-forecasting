In this project, we aim to predict stock trade values using time series forecasting. We will leverage the power of TensorFlow, a popular machine learning library, to build our prediction models.

## Objectives
1. Understand the historical trading data of a chosen stock.
2. Implement time series forecasting to predict future trade values.
3. Develop both single-step and multi-step forecasting models.
4. Use different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for building the models.
5. Compare the performance of the LSTM and GRU models.

## Steps
1. Data Collection: Gather historical stock trading data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the data for better model performance.
3. Model Building: Build LSTM and GRU models using TensorFlow.
4. Training: Train the models on the preprocessed data.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the models' performance on test data.
6. Prediction: Use the trained models to predict future stock trade values.

By the end of this project, we will have a robust system capable of predicting stock trade values, which could be a valuable tool for traders and financial analysts.
